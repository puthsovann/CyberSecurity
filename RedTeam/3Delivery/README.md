In the Delivery step, the intruder launches the attack. The specific steps taken will depend on the type of attack they intend to carry out. For example, the attacker may send email attachments or a malicious link to spur user activity to advance the plan. This activity may be combined with social engineering techniques to increase the effectiveness of the campaign.

* Exploit a browser vulnerability to deliver the malware by tricking your staff to visit a compromised website and so infect the computer they are using at their desk.
* Web applications that accept user input can be attacked by sending specially crafted data to forms in a web application (eg SQL injection attacks).
* Email containing malicious attachments, perhaps masquerading as a new customer order or an invoice to be paid â€“ this makes it much more likely that your staff will open the attachment.
* The malware could also be loaded into a USB memory stick, or even a special cable (e.g. OMG cables) and left in your reception, dropped in the car park or even given away at a trade show in the hope staff will return to the office, plug the device into their computer and so infect their computer with the malware.

## SQL Injection
*SQL injection* is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.
