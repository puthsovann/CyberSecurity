During the Reconnaissance phase, a malicious actor identifies a target and explores vulnerabilities and weaknesses that can be exploited within the network. As part of this process, the attacker may harvest login credentials or gather other information, such as email addresses, user IDs, physical locations, software applications and operating system details, all of which may be useful in phishing or spoofing attacks. Generally speaking, the more information the attacker is able to gather during the Reconnaissance phase, the more sophisticated and convincing the attack will be and, hence, the higher the likelihood of success.

Sun Tzu once said, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”

# Passive Reconnaissance
***Passive recon*** is when you gather information about a target without directly interacting with the target. This means that you don't send any type of request to the target and therefore the target has no way of knowing that you are gathering information on them.
## OSINT
[***Open-source intelligence***](OSINT) - is the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources (overt and publicly available sources) to produce actionable intelligence.  
* [Google Hacking DataBase](OSINT/GHDB.md)
* [TheHarvester](OSINT/TheHarvester.md) is another tool like sublist3r which is developed using Python.
* Shodan
* Maltego
* Metagoofil
* Recon-Ng
* Check Usernames
* TinEye
* Creepy
* [DNS Enumeration](OSINT/DNS.md)

## Vulnerability Database or CVE
* [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) - Exploit Database (ExploitDB) is an archive of exploits for the purpose of public security, and it explains what can be found on the database.
* [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search) - National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the U.S. government repository of standards based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).
* [CVE Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/) - is a list of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities that is free to search, use, and incorporate into products and services
* ***searchsploit*** which allows you to search ExploitDB from your own machine. This is offline, and works using a downloaded version of the database, meaning that you already have all of the exploits already on your Kali Linux!
