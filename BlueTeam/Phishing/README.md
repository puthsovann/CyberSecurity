# Phishing Email

Below are typical characteristics phishing emails have in common:
* The sender email name/address will masquerade as a trusted entity (email spoofing)
* The email subject line and/or body (text) is written with a sense of urgency or uses certain keywords such as Invoice, Suspended, etc.
* The email body (HTML) is designed to match a trusting entity (such as Amazon)
* The email body (HTML) is poorly formatted or written (contrary from the previous point)
* The email body uses generic content, such as Dear Sir/Madam.
* Hyperlinks (oftentimes uses URL shortening services to hide its true origin)
* A malicious attachment posing as a legitimate document
