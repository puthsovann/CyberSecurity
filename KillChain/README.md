# Reconnaissance
The attacker gathers information on the target before the actual attack starts. He can do it by looking for publicly available information on the Internet. [More](1Recon)

# Weaponization
The attacker uses an exploit and creates a malicious payload to send to the victim. This step happens at the attacker side, without contact with the victim. [More](2Weapon/README.md)

#Delivery
The attacker sends the malicious payload to the victim by email or other means, which represents one of many intrusion methods the attacker can use. [More](3Delivery/README.md)
