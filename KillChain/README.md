# Reconnaissance
The attacker gathers information on the target before the actual attack starts. He can do it by looking for publicly available information on the Internet. [More](1Recon)

# Weaponization
The attacker uses an exploit and creates a malicious payload to send to the victim. This step happens at the attacker side, without contact with the victim. [More](2Weapon)

# Delivery
The attacker sends the malicious payload to the victim by email or other means, which represents one of many intrusion methods the attacker can use.  [More](3Delivery)

# Exploitation
The actual execution of the exploit, which is, again, relevant only when the attacker uses an exploit. [More](4Exploit)

# Installation
Installing malware on the infected computer is relevant only if the attacker used malware as part of the attack, and even when there is malware involved, the installation is a point in time within a much more elaborate attack process that takes months to operate. [More](5Install)

# Command and control
The attacker creates a command and control channel in order to continue to operate his internal assets remotely. This step is relatively generic and relevant throughout the attack, not only when malware is installed. [More](6C2Server)

# Action on objectives
The attacker performs the steps to achieve his actual goals inside the victimâ€™s network. This is the elaborate active attack process that takes months, and thousands of small steps, in order to achieve. [More](7ActionOnObj)
